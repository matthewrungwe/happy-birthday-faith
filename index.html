                            This year is a as much a milestone as your 21<sup>st</sup>. 
                            You have come a long way and you have endured a lot. Today 
                            as any other day it marks the birth of a new you and a better you. 
                            Life going forwards is just going to be life. It is going to be 
                            filled happy, sad, fun, painful, joyful and challenging moments. 
                            At least this time you would have a mutual and better perspective. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You are a strong woman and you are only going to get stronger. 
                            Remember that you are amazing and you are a force to be reckoned 
                            with. May God continue to watch over you and bless you in all you 
                            pray for and all you do.

                            What's going to become apparent over the years is that your faith 
                            and your decisions will become very important. You will find yourself
                            in the deep end a few times. To make better decisions, know your heart 
                            can deceive you. Pay attention to red flags and don't do what doesn't 
                            feel right in your heart. Ask yourself what story you want to tell tomorrow
                            and make a decisions that will bring smiles. Do the right thing always
                            and don't wait until it's too late to change. Do everything with love.

                            Live your life with faith, stand for what you believe in and have hope
                            for what you do not yet see. Your faith will be the only thing that can 
                            hold you through the tide.
